#1-Basics of JS
1.1-multiparadigm programming language
      -functional programming
    -object oriented programming 

Code of software(Program)--->run-->loaded to our RAM-it becomes a process.

1.2-Keywords
in a programming language. few words are reserved by the language for its own purpose. we can not chnage their meaning or re purpose them for a different use case.
i.e in JS,few keywords are - let,var,const,if else, return etc.

Ques- How can we store some values inside a program?
To store some values we use variables.
RAM->process space -> Bucket(name/label)-inside the bucket we store the data.
Variables are memory bucket that stores our value and has a name also.

#2-Coding variables in JS
    3 ways to create variables
    2.1-using var keyword
    var <variable name> =<value>;
    var marks=90;
    var score=5;

    2.2- using let keyword
    let <variable-name>=<value>;
    let age =24;
    let flag=0;

    2.3- using const keyword
    const <variable-name>=<value>
    const x=100;


2.4- semicolon
when we write one line of js code that is equivalent to one complete instruction.its a ststament,at the end of every statement in js we can put a semicolon but (its optional.)its recommended to write sensible js code so use semicolon after every valid js statement.

2.5- Namaing rules

    2.5.1- variable can contain small alphabets ,capital alphabet,digits ,underscore.
    2.5.2. we van not have space or any other special character.
    2.5.3. we should give meaningful names so that reader can idenity the names properly.
    2.5.4- variables name can not be start with a digit but it can have digits in between or at the last.
    i.e 0james=10; x
    2.5.5- we can not use keywords as variables.

2.6 - showing data to User
    input->function(acts as a blackbox->output)
    2.6.1- console.log -inbuilt function 
        this function takes some data as an input and then displays them in the output.
        console.log(10);
    2.6.2- if we have 2 different console.log() then both of them displays/prints output in different line.
    we can also pass multiple values together to console.log()and all of them will be on same line.
    console.log(10,"starting",age);-comma seperated values.


2.7 - what all values we can store in js?
    (official docume3nttaion of js is written by ecma international)
    we can also refer MDN from mozilla.
    2.7.1-  Number-> 10,-3,2.6,3.44,1000 etc
            String -> "Texts",'text',`text`
            Boolean -> true,false {also a keywords in js}
            undefined- also a keyword in js .something not defined yet but may be defined later.
            Objects->if we have to somehow store key value pairs then we can use objects.{
                <key,value>-keys will be unique.
                name:"vikas"
                company:'Google'
                position:"software engg"
            }
            {
                name:"rahul"
                company:"phonepe"
                position:"backend engg"
            }
            {
                NAME:'IPHONE'
                COST:125000
                COLOR:'ROSE GOLD'
                DISCOUNT:5
                DESC:"THE NEW APPLE IPHONE"
            }
            *Null and undeifned both shows sense of emptiness.
            let a; ---undefined
            let b =10;
            b=null; - now value is empty
            Null-sense of emptiness
            it actually represents empty value.





             
            var condition=true;
            var status =undefined;
            var score=70;
            var player_name="Dhoni";
           
        



#2.8-Types of data
    Primitve-types which are atomic in nature.
    Non Primitive-types which are a composotion of other types i.e objects.
 {
    name:"vikas"
    age:25
    posts:{
        creationdate:"june 12,2022"
        texts:"my first post"
    }
    gender:"male"

 } 
 objects inside objects (nesting )



 2.9 - special charcters,escape sequence
 "the name apple "iphone"
 "has been launched"

 "the new apple iphone \n has been laucnhed" 


 2.10- comments
    comments are a piece of code that is for documentation purpose. 
    the programming langyage ,will just avoid comments during execution.
    2.10.1- single line comment -//
    2.10.2- multiline comment - /*.....*/


2.11- Operators/Arithmatic and Assignment
    -there are different types of Operators.
    1-Arithmatic Operators
        +-addition
        --subtraction
        /--devision
        *-multiplication
        %-modulo
        **-exponent
    operand - value on which we use the operation.
    2.11.2- Assignment Operators
        =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=
        let a =10;
        a+=2;- means a is equal to a+2.
