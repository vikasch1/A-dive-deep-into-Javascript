        1-Unary Operators
            let a =10;
            a++;

            let a =10;
            let y=a++;

            let a =9;
            let y=++a;

    a++ - postfix unary addition (inc after assignment)
    y=a++;
    step1- we first assign the value of a (old value) to y.
    step2- then value of a is incremented by 1.

    ++a - prefix (inc first then assign)
    let a =10;
    y=++a;


a-- - first assignment then decrement
--a = first decrement then assign


# unary +  - it tries to convert a variable into a number if its not already a number.
+x

# unary - = it also converts a variable into number but it always gives negative value;
-x;

#typeof operator

#Ternary operator -- ? :
let y =(condition)?(exp1):(exp2);
if condition true, result- exp1
if condition false, resulu-exp 2


# if else vs ternary operation?
for one liner logic go for ternary.
for multiple things go for if else or else if.


#switch case
switch-keyword
        syntax:
                switch(value or expression){
                    case value1 :
                    //logic
                    break;
                    case value 2 :
                      //logic
                    break;

                    case value 3 :
                      //logic
                    break;


                    default:
                }
        switch(value/expression)
            whatever value of expression gets calculated ,we can use that value and check for the case.
    -- default is not mandatory, if none of the case matches, it wont give any output.
    -- it is madatory to put break as to perform logical separation. 


# roots of quad eqn?
         D formula
         two roots


# string comparison
in ===, if the types are different, it immediately return false.
but in ==, if typeS ARE DIFF , IT TRIES TO CHANGE THE TYPE(TYPE CONVERSION)
