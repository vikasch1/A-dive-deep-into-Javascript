            -standard guidelines.
            -REST API- any api that follows the recommendations of REST is REST API.

            Rest provides a bunch of guidelines to prepare api.
                -rest prefers a client server communication should happen over http.
                -rest prefers json as the format to send and recieve data.
                -rest gives guidelines on how the url should look like.
                -in rest the main source of info is considered as resource.
                i.e tweet is a resource but create tweet/delete tweer is an action.
                resource consider as noun and actions are considered as verbs.
                -the end points/url should be noun not verbs. i.e medium.com/blogs
                                                                medium.com/blogs/1
                -these nouns should be plural.the noun that we mention are expected to be plural 
                -every rest end point should be defined along with a http method(get put post patch delete etc)
                            -GET -retrieve some data 
                            -POST - sending data /creating resource
                            -DELETE - delete medium.com/blogs, deleet a resource
                            PUT- Update a resource
                            -patch- partially update a resource
                -rest expects the response to have http codes.
