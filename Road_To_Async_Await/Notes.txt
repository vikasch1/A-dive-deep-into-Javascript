functions are first class citizen in js environemnt (community jargon).[we can return functions from function, pass function as argument etc etc].
Closure-Remember your context.
-persistent memory location for all the previous variables.
-closing over values
-symbolic to remembering the scope of variable.
-inner function remembers/have snapchot of lexical scopes of its outer function even after the outer function is already executed and is wipe out nfrom the call stack.

                    (types of programming languages -imperative language and declarative language)
#Iterators
-here we actually dedicatedly define the collection and mention the steps to get data from the collection.
-it has two props i.e value and done.
-with every Iterators we have next( function and it returns value and done )
-done tells us if we have consumed all value from collection or not.
-Iterators are basically used to achieve declarative programming from imperative programming .

#Generators
    -these are functions whose execution is not continous. we can break the execution in bw and restart after some time.
    -function star syntax.
    -they always return a Iterators.
    -YIELD keyword.=similar to return but not a return.
    -the execution of Generator function doesnt start when calling the function.
