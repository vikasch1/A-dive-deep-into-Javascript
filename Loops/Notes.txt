Things to do again n again.
same task repeatedly.
using loops we will be able to repeat a task again n again.

ques- write a program to print the numbers from 1 to N?
let i=1;
let N =100;
while(i<=N){
    console.log(i);
    i=i+1;
}

let N =50;
for(let i=1;i<=N;i++){
     console.log(i);

}

ques= what is the difference bw while and if?
if will only check the condition once,doesnt matter if the condition is true or false. it will only check it once.
whereas while loop checks condition again n again ,till the time it becomes false.


problem 1: WAP to calculate sum of all the no. from 1 to 10?


    #For Loop;
    for loops are one more way to do same thing as of while loop.there is no particular advantage of using a particular loop.
    in for loops the difference is only in syntax.
    for(initiate;conditiom;update){
        //do some work.
    }

        variable initiate;
        while(condition){
            ..logic
            update
        }


problem - print 1 to 10 using for loop?
